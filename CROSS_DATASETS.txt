My first query of cross_datasets would compared the number of current confirmed cases in Lombardia  on March 28, 2020, region in Italy with highest amount of COVID-19 cases to global average amount of COVID-19 cases on March 28, 2020.

To achieve this result, I join ConfirmedGlobal_SQL_Final from CovidGlobal_modeled to 3_28_SQL_Final from CovidItaly_modeled on matching uid. I then used aggegrate function of sum and avg to produce desired result. Finally, I used where clause to filter out regions that are not Lombardia.


My second query would compared the average number of confirmed cases in Lombardia from March 24, 2020 to March 28, 2020, to global peaks of deaths from COVID-19 cases from March 24, 2020 to March 28, 2020.

To do this second query, I join DeathGlobal_SQL_Final from CovidGlobal_modeled to all tables from CovidItaly_modeled on mathcing uid. Again I made use of aggegrate functions and group by regions. Finally I used where clause to filter out regions that are not Lombardia.
